U3 Color Coding Guesses
AC 1 - When a player gets the correct word, it should be displayed as all green characters
AC 2 - When a player guesses a word with some correct, out-of-place, and incorrect characters the colour coding informs
       them of this with green for correct characters, yellow for characters that exist in the word but are in the
       wrong position, and gray for characters that are not in the word.

U4 Playing the game manually
AC 1 - When playing the game with manual guesses each guess correctly adds to the number of guesses
AC 2 - When playing the game, I cannot make a guess with a 4-letter word
AC 3 - When playing the game, I can ask for a hint and see the possible words up to a maximum of 5

U5 Undo and Redo guesses
AC 1 - When playing the game manually, after making a guess I can undo my guess. And this guess will be removed from my guesses and my number of guesses will be reduced
AC 2 - If I have any number of undone guess I can redo these operations in reverse order (last in first out) to return to the state I was at
AC 3 - If I have an undone guess, when I make another guess I can no longer redo my last undo operation
AC 4 - If I have a redone guess, when I undo this redone guess is undone again
